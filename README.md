# text_to_plot_codex

Welcome to the Text-to-Plot Flask app.

This app utilizes the Codex API to generate plots from text commands after uploading a CSV file. It is designed to be a convenient tool for data analysts, scientists, and anyone interested in visualizing their data.

To use the app, users simply need to upload their CSV file and enter their desired plot commands. The app will then generate a variety of plots based on the inputted information. This process can save time and effort compared to manually creating plots in a program such as Excel or Google Sheets.

Overall, the Text-to-Plot app is a useful tool for generating a range of plots from data using simple text commands. It can be helpful for visualizing trends, identifying patterns, and gaining a better understanding of data. We hope you find it useful.

Please note that we are currently in the process of updating the app to improve its accuracy.
